\paragraph{}In physics, \textbf{mass-energy equivalence} is the relationship between mass and energy in a system's rest frame, where the two values differ only by a constant and the units of measurement. The principle is described by the physicist Albert Einstein's famous formula:

\begin{equation}
  E=mc^{2}

the formula implies that a small amount of rest mass corresponds to an enormous amount of energy, which is independent of the composition of the matter.
